# ETL PIPELINE OVERVIEW:

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process commonly used in data preprocessing for machine learning projects. It takes a raw dataset in CSV format, cleans and transforms it using Scikit-learn pipelines, and saves a ready-to-use dataset for model training.

Extract: Get data from one or more sources (CSV, database, API).

Transform: Clean, filter, or enrich the data.

Load: Store the transformed data into a destination (CSV, database, etc.).
